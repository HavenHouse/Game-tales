Welcome to the Repository of the Haven Writers Guild Co-Authoring Collection.

Feel free to add your game/character/writing as appropriate.  The simple tree format should suffice, if we need to change it over time, it can be done.  Please branch under game/character to suit.  While some GMs prefer the game/GM/writings, don't be surprised if game/NPC/character/writings show up, or even named NPCs as if they are simply game/character/writings.  Some writings might be cross-linked in multiple places.  Please use soft-links for such.

Thank you, and enjoy.
